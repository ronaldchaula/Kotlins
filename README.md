# Kotlins
Kotlin is a JVM based programming language, can also be called a version of java (dilect), that was created by JetBrains and released 2011
It is less verbose than Java hence improves how to write code with more efficiency

I will document my learning journey through this markdown and also share what I build with the language

> ## Syntax

### __*variables*__
- Variables in Kotlin can only be created through two keywords _val_ and *var* .
- __val__ is a single assigned time variable or commonly called a constant, val makes a variable behave like a final classed variable in Java
- __Var__ is a constant changing variable, a true variable, variables are also called identifiers in many languages hence here are called the same name
### _Strings_

<!-- code blocks will have to be back ticked-->
`var name:String?`
